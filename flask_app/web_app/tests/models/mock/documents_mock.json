Some credit institutions became overly dependent on short term financing which rapidly dried up at the onset of the crisis. Such credit institutions then became vulnerable to liquidity demands because they were not holding a sufficient volume of liquid assets to meet demands to withdraw funds (outflows) during the stressed period. Credit institutions were then forced to liquidate assets in a fire-sale which created a self-reinforcing downward price spiral and lack of market confidence triggering a solvency crisis. Ultimately many credit institutions became excessively dependent on liquidity provision by the central banks and had to be bailed out by the injection of massive amount of funds from the public purse. Thus it became apparent that it was necessary to develop a detailed liquidity coverage requirement whose aim should be to avoid this risk by making credit institutions less dependent on short-term financing and central bank liquidity provision and more resilient to sudden liquidity shocks.", "", "(2)", "", "Article 412(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 imposes a liquidity coverage requirement on credit institutions formulated in general terms as an obligation to hold ‘liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions’. Pursuant to Article 460 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the Commission is empowered to specify in detail that liquidity coverage requirement and the circumstances under which competent authorities have to impose specific in- and outflow levels on credit institutions in order to capture specific risks to which they are exposed. In accordance with Recital 101 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the rules should be comparable to the liquidity coverage ratio set out in the international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (‘BCBS’), taking into account Union and national specificities. Until the full implementation of the liquidity coverage requirement from 1 January 2018, Member States should be able to apply a liquidity coverage requirement up to 100 % for credit institutions in accordance with national law.", "", "(3)", "", "Consistent with BCBS liquidity standards, rules should be adopted to define the liquidity coverage requirement as a ratio of a credit institution's buffer of ‘liquid assets’ to its ‘net liquidity outflows’ over a 30 calendar day stress period. ‘Net liquidity outflows’ should be calculated by deducting the credit institution's liquidity inflows from its liquidity outflows. The liquidity coverage ratio should be expressed as a percentage and set at a minimum level of 100 %, when fully implemented, which indicates that a credit institution holds sufficient liquid assets to meet its net liquidity outflows during a 30-day stress period. During such a period, a credit institution should be able to convert quickly its liquid assets into cash without recourse to central bank liquidity or public funds, which may result in its liquidity coverage ratio falling temporarily below the 100 % level. Should that occur or be expected to occur at any time, credit institutions should comply with the specific requirements laid down in Article 414 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for a timely restoration of their liquidity coverage ratio to the minimum level.", "", "(4)", "", "Only freely transferable assets that can be converted quickly into cash in private markets within a short timeframe and without significant loss in value should be defined as ‘liquid assets’ for the purposes of credit institutions' liquidity buffers. Consistent with Part Six of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the BCBS classification of liquid assets, appropriate rules should differentiate between assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality or level 1 assets, and assets of high liquidity and credit quality or level 2 assets. The latter should be further divided into level 2A and 2B assets. Credit institutions should hold an adequately diversified buffer of liquid assets, having regard to their relative liquidity and credit quality. Accordingly, each level and sub-level should be subject to specific requirements on haircuts and limits of the overall buffer and, where appropriate, differentiated requirements should be applied between levels or sub-levels and between categories of liquid assets in the same level or sub-level, which should be more stringent the lower their liquidity classification.", "", "(5)", "", "Certain general and operational requirements should be applied to liquid assets to ensure they can be converted into cash within a short timeframe, subject to some exceptions for specified level 1 assets where appropriate. These requirements should specify that liquid assets should be held free from any obstacle preventing their disposal, easy to value and listed on recognised exchanges or tradable on active sale or repurchase markets. They should also ensure that the credit institution's liquidity management function has access to and control of its liquid assets at all times and that the assets comprising the liquidity buffer are appropriately diversified. Diversification is important to ensure that a credit institution's ability to rapidly liquidate liquid assets without a significant loss in value is not compromised by those assets being vulnerable to a common risk factor. Credit institutions should also be required to ensure consistency of the currency denomination of their liquid assets and their net liquidity outflows, to prevent an excessive currency mismatch from compromising their ability to use their liquidity buffer to meet liquidity outflows in a specific currency in a stress period.", "", "(6)", "", "In accordance with the recommendations made by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in its report of 20 December 2013, prepared pursuant to Article 509(3) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all types of bonds issued or guaranteed by Member States' central governments and central banks as well as those issued or guaranteed by supranational institutions should be given level 1 status. As the EBA noted, there are strong supervisory arguments for not discriminating between various Member States because the exclusion of some sovereign bonds from level 1 would create incentives to invest in other sovereign bonds within the Union, which would result in the fragmentation of the internal market and increase the risk of mutual contagion in a crisis between credit institutions and their sovereigns (the ‘bank-sovereign nexus’). As regards third countries, level 1 status should be given to exposures to central banks and sovereigns which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under the credit risk rules in Title II of Part 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as is provided for in the BCBS standard. Exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities should be given level 1 status only where they are treated as exposures to their central government and the latter benefits from a 0 % risk weight in accordance with the same credit risk rules. The same status should apply to exposures to 0 % risk-weighted multilateral development banks and international organisations. Given the extremely high liquidity and credit quality demonstrated by those assets, credit institutions should be allowed to hold them in their buffers without limit and they should not be subject to a haircut or a diversification requirement.", "", "(7)", "", "Assets issued by credit institutions should generally not be recognised as liquid assets, but level 1 treatment should be conferred upon bank assets supported by Member States governments, such as promotional and government-owned lenders as well as private bank assets with an explicit State guarantee. The latter constitute a legacy from the financial crisis that should be phased-out and, accordingly, only bank assets with a government guarantee granted or committed to prior to 30 June 2014 should be eligible as liquid assets. Similarly, senior bonds issued by certain specified asset management agencies of certain Member States should be treated as level 1 assets subject to the same requirements applicable to exposures to the central government of their respective Member State but only with a time-limited effect.", "", "(8)", "", "Covered bonds are debt instruments issued by credit institutions and secured by a cover pool of assets which typically consist of mortgage loans or public sector debt to which investors have a preferential claim in the event of default. Their secured nature and certain additional safety features, such as the requirement on the issuer to replace non-performing assets in the cover pool and maintain the cover pool at a value exceeding the par value of the bonds (‘asset coverage requirement’), have contributed to make covered bonds relatively low-risk, yield-bearing instruments with a key funding role in mortgage markets of most Member States. In certain Member States outstanding covered bond issuance exceeds the pool of outstanding government bonds. Certain covered bonds of credit quality step 1, in particular, exhibited an excellent liquidity performance during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2012 analysed by the EBA in its report. Nevertheless the EBA recommended treating these covered bonds as level 2A assets to align with BCBS standards. However, in the light of the considerations made above about their credit quality, liquidity performance and role in the funding markets of the Union, it is appropriate for these credit quality step 1 covered bonds to be treated as level 1 assets. In order to avoid excessive concentration risks and unlike other level 1 assets, the holdings of credit quality step 1 covered bonds in the liquidity buffer should be subject to a 70 % cap of the overall buffer, a minimum 7 % haircut and to the diversification requirement.", "", "(9)", "", "Covered bonds of credit quality step 2 should be recognised as level 2A assets subject to the same cap (40 %) and haircut (15 %) applicable to other liquid assets of this level. This can be justified on the basis of available market data which indicate that credit quality step 2 covered bonds exhibited greater liquidity than other comparable level 2A and 2B assets, such as residential mortgage-backed securities (‘RMBSs’) of credit quality step 1. Furthermore, permitting these covered bonds to qualify for the purposes of the liquidity buffer would contribute to diversifying the pool of available assets within the buffer and prevent an undue discrimination or a cliff effect between them and covered bonds of credit quality step 1. It should be noted, however, that a significant proportion of these covered bonds became credit quality step 2 as a result of the downgrade in the rating of the Member State's central government where their issuer was established. This reflected the country ceiling typically included in the methodologies of rating agencies which determines that financial instruments may not be rated over a certain level relative to their respective sovereign rating. Hence, country ceilings precluded the covered bonds issued in those Member States from reaching credit quality step 1, irrespective of their credit quality, which in turn reduced their liquidity compared with covered bonds of similar quality issued in Member States that were not downgraded. Funding markets within the Union have become greatly fragmented as a result, which highlights the need to find an appropriate alternative to external ratings as one of criteria in prudential regulation to classify the liquidity and credit risk of covered bonds and other categories of assets. In accordance with Article 39b(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the Commission must report by 31 December 2015 on alternative tools to credit ratings, with a view to deleting all references to credit ratings in Union law for regulatory purposes by 1 January 2020.", "", "(10)", "", "In relation to asset-backed securities (‘ABS’), the EBA had recommended, consistent with its own empirical findings and with the BCBS standard, that only RMBSs of credit quality step 1 be recognised as level 2B assets, subject to a 25 % haircut. It is also appropriate to deviate from this recommendation and expand level 2B eligibility to certain ABSs backed by other assets. A broader range of eligible subcategories of assets would increase diversification within the liquidity buffer and facilitate the financing of the real economy. Furthermore, as available market data points to a low correlation between ABSs and other liquid assets such as government bonds, the bank-sovereign nexus would be weakened and fragmentation in the internal market would be mitigated. In addition, there is evidence that investors tend to hoard high quality ABSs with short weighted-average life and high prepayments during periods of financial instability, as these convert into cash quickly and can be relied upon as a safe source of liquidity. This is particularly the case of ABSs backed by loans and leases for the financing of motor vehicles (‘auto loan ABSs’), which exhibited price volatility and average spreads comparable to RMBSs during the 2007-2012 period. Certain sections of consumer credit ABSs, such as credit cards, also showed comparable good levels of liquidity. Lastly, allowing ABSs backed by real economy assets, such as those mentioned already and loans to SMEs, could contribute to economic growth as it would send a positive signal to investors in relation to these assets. Appropriate rules should therefore recognise ABSs backed not just by residential mortgage loans, but also by auto loans, consumer credit and SME loans as level 2B assets. However to preserve the integrity and functionality of the liquidity buffer, their eligibility should be subject to certain high quality requirements consistent with the criteria to be applied to simple, transparent and standardised securitisations in other financial sectorial legislation. For RMBSs in particular, high quality requirements should include complying with certain ratios on loan-to-value or loan-to-income, but those ratios should not apply to RMBS issued before the starting date of application of the liquidity coverage requirement. To account for the less high liquidity observed in consumer credit and SME loan ABSs relative to RMBSs and auto loan ABSs, the former should be subject to a higher haircut (35 %). All ABSs should be subject, like other level 2B assets, to the overall 15 % cap of the liquidity buffer and to the diversification requirement.", "", "(11)", "", "The rules in relation to the classification, requirements, caps and haircuts for the remaining level 2A and 2B assets should align closely with the BCBS's and the EBA's recommendations. Shares and units in collective investment undertakings (‘CIU’), on the other hand, should be treated as liquid assets of the same level and category as the assets underlying the collective undertaking.", "", "(12)", "", "It is also appropriate in determining the liquidity coverage ratio to take into account the centralised management of liquidity in cooperative and institutional protection scheme networks where the central institution or body plays a role akin to a central bank because the members of the network do not typically have direct access to the latter. Appropriate rules should, therefore, recognise as liquid assets the sight deposits which are made by the members of the network with the central institution and other liquidity funding available to those from the central institution. Deposits which do not qualify as liquid assets should benefit from the preferential outflow rates allowed for operational deposits.", "", "(13)", "", "The outflow rate for stable retail deposits should be set at a default rate of 5 %, but a preferential outflow rate of 3 % should be allowed to all credit institutions affiliated to a deposit guarantee scheme in a Member State that meets certain stringent criteria. First, account should be taken of the implementation of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive 2014/49/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) by Member States. Second, the scheme of a Member State should comply with specific requirements relating to the repayment period, ex-ante funding and access to additional financial means in the event of a large call on its reserves. Last, the application of the preferential 3 % rate should be subject to the Commission's prior approval, which should be granted only where the Commission is satisfied that the deposit guarantee scheme of the Member State complies with the above criteria and there are no overriding concerns regarding the functioning of the internal market for retail deposits. In any event, the 3 % preferential rate for stable retail deposits should not be applicable before 1 January 2019.", "", "(14)", "", "Credit institutions should be able to identify other retail deposits subject to higher run-off rates. Appropriate rules based on the EBA Guidelines on retail deposits subject to different outflows should set out the criteria to identify those retail deposits on the basis of their specific features, namely the size of the total deposit, the nature of the deposit, the remuneration, the probability of withdrawal and whether the depositor is resident or non-resident.", "", "(15)", "", "It may not be assumed that credit institutions will always receive liquidity support from other undertakings belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme when they experience difficulties in meeting their payment obligations. However, where no waiver has been granted for the application of the liquidity coverage ratio at individual level in accordance with Articles 8 or 10 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, liquidity flows between two credit institutions belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme should in principle receive symmetrical inflow and outflow rates to avoid the loss of liquidity in the internal market, provided that all the necessary safeguards are in place and only with the prior approval of the competent authorities involved. Such preferential treatment should only be given to cross-border flows on the basis of additional objective criteria, including the low liquidity risk profile of the provider and the receiver.", "", "(16)", "", "In order to prevent credit institutions from relying solely on anticipated inflows to meet their liquidity coverage ratio, and also to ensure a minimum level of liquid assets holdings, the amount of inflows that can offset outflows should be capped at 75 % of total expected outflows. However, taking into account the existence of specialised business models, certain exemptions to this cap, either full or partial, should be permitted to give effect to the principle of proportionality and subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities. That should include an exemption for intra-group and intra-institutional protection scheme flows and credit institutions specialised in pass-through mortgage lending or in leasing and factoring. In addition, credit institutions specialised in financing for the acquisition of motor vehicles or in consumer credit loans should be allowed to apply a higher cap of 90 %. Those exemptions should be available at both the individual and consolidated level, but only where certain criteria are fulfilled.", "", "(17)", "", "The liquidity coverage ratio should apply to credit institutions both on an individual and consolidated basis, unless the competent authorities waive the application on an individual basis in accordance with Articles 8 or 10 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The consolidation of subsidiary undertakings in third countries should take due account of the liquidity coverage requirements applicable in those countries. Accordingly, consolidation rules in the Union should not give a more favourable treatment to liquid assets, liquidity outflows or inflows in third country subsidiary undertakings than that which is available under the national law of those third countries.", "", "(18)", "", "In accordance with Article 508(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the Commission must report to the co-legislators by no later than 31 December 2015 on whether and how the liquidity coverage requirement laid down in Part Six should apply to investment firms. Until that provision starts to apply, investment firms should remain subject to the national law of Member States on the liquidity coverage requirement. However, investment firms should be subject to the liquidity coverage ratio laid down in this Regulation on a consolidated basis, where they form part of banking groups.", "", "(19)", "", "Credit institutions are required to report to their competent authorities the liquidity coverage requirement as specified in detail in this Regulation in accordance with Article 415 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.", "", "(20)", "", "In order to give credit institutions sufficient time to comply with the detailed liquidity coverage requirement in full, its introduction should be phased-in in accordance with the timetable laid down in Article 460(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, starting with a minimum of 60 % from 1 October 2015 rising to 100 % on 1 January 2018,", "", "HAS ADOPTED THIS

Money laundering, terrorism financing and organised crime remain significant problems which should be addressed at Union level. In addition to further developing the criminal law approach at Union level, targeted and proportionate prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing is indispensable and can produce complementary results.", "", "(2)", "", "The soundness, integrity and stability of credit institutions and financial institutions, and confidence in the financial system as a whole could be seriously jeopardised by the efforts of criminals and their associates to disguise the origin of criminal proceeds or to channel lawful or illicit money for terrorist purposes. In order to facilitate their criminal activities, money launderers and financers of terrorism could try to take advantage of the freedom of capital movements and the freedom to supply financial services which the Union's integrated financial area entails. Therefore, certain coordinating measures are necessary at Union level. At the same time, the objectives of protecting society from crime and protecting the stability and integrity of the Union's financial system should be balanced against the need to create a regulatory environment that allows companies to grow their businesses without incurring disproportionate compliance costs.", "", "(3)", "", "This Directive is the fourth directive to address the threat of money laundering. Council Directive 91/308/EEC (4) defined money laundering in terms of drugs offences and imposed obligations solely on the financial sector. Directive 2001/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) extended the scope of Directive 91/308/EEC both in terms of the crimes covered and in terms of the range of professions and activities covered. In June 2003, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised its Recommendations to cover terrorist financing, and provided more detailed requirements in relation to customer identification and verification, the situations where a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing may justify enhanced measures and also the situations where a reduced risk may justify less rigorous controls. Those changes were reflected in Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and in Commission Directive 2006/70/EC (7).", "", "(4)", "", "Money laundering and terrorist financing are frequently carried out in an international context. Measures adopted solely at national or even at Union level, without taking into account international coordination and cooperation, would have very limited effect. The measures adopted by the Union in that field should therefore be compatible with, and at least as stringent as, other actions undertaken in international fora. Union action should continue to take particular account of the FATF Recommendations and instruments of other international bodies active in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. With a view to reinforcing the efficacy of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the relevant Union legal acts should, where appropriate, be aligned with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the FATF in February 2012 (the ‘revised FATF Recommendations’).", "", "(5)", "", "Furthermore, the misuse of the financial system to channel illicit or even lawful money into terrorist purposes poses a clear risk to the integrity, proper functioning, reputation and stability of the financial system. Accordingly, the preventive measures laid down in this Directive should address the manipulation of money derived from serious crime and the collection of money or property for terrorist purposes.", "", "(6)", "", "The use of large cash payments is highly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. In order to increase vigilance and mitigate the risks posed by such cash payments, persons trading in goods should be covered by this Directive to the extent that they make or receive cash payments of EUR 10 000 or more. Member States should be able to adopt lower thresholds, additional general limitations to the use of cash and further stricter provisions.", "", "(7)", "", "The use of electronic money products is increasingly considered to be a substitute for bank accounts, which, in addition to the measures laid down in Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), justifies subjecting those products to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. However, in certain proven low-risk circumstances and under strict risk-mitigating conditions, Member States should be allowed to exempt electronic money products from certain customer due diligence measures, such as the identification and verification of the customer and of the beneficial owner, but not from the monitoring of transactions or of business relationships. The risk-mitigating conditions should include a requirement that exempt electronic money products be used exclusively for purchasing goods or services, and that the amount stored electronically be low enough to preclude circumvention of the AML/CFT rules. Such an exemption should be without prejudice to the discretion given to Member States to allow obliged entities to apply simplified customer due diligence measures to other electronic money products posing lower risks, in accordance with Article 15.", "", "(8)", "", "As concerns the obliged entities which are subject to this Directive, estate agents could be understood to include letting agents, where applicable.", "", "(9)", "", "Legal professionals, as defined by the Member States, should be subject to this Directive when participating in financial or corporate transactions, including when providing tax advice, where there is the greatest risk of the services of those legal professionals being misused for the purpose of laundering the proceeds of criminal activity or for the purpose of terrorist financing. There should, however, be exemptions from any obligation to report information obtained before, during or after judicial proceedings, or in the course of ascertaining the legal position of a client. Therefore, legal advice should remain subject to the obligation of professional secrecy, except where the legal professional is taking part in money laundering or terrorist financing, the legal advice is provided for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, or the legal professional knows that the client is seeking legal advice for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.", "", "(10)", "", "Directly comparable services should be treated in the same manner when provided by any of the professionals covered by this Directive. In order to ensure respect for the rights guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), in the case of auditors, external accountants and tax advisors, who, in some Member States, are entitled to defend or represent a client in the context of judicial proceedings or to ascertain a client's legal position, the information they obtain in the performance of those tasks should not be subject to the reporting obligations laid down in this Directive.", "", "(11)", "", "It is important expressly to highlight that ‘tax crimes’ relating to direct and indirect taxes are included in the broad definition of ‘criminal activity’ in this Directive, in line with the revised FATF Recommendations. Given that different tax offences may be designated in each Member State as constituting ‘criminal activity’ punishable by means of the sanctions as referred to in point (4)(f) of Article 3 of this Directive, national law definitions of tax crimes may diverge. While no harmonisation of the definitions of tax crimes in Member States' national law is sought, Member States should allow, to the greatest extent possible under their national law, the exchange of information or the provision of assistance between EU Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).", "", "(12)", "", "There is a need to identify any natural person who exercises ownership or control over a legal entity. In order to ensure effective transparency, Member States should ensure that the widest possible range of legal entities incorporated or created by any other mechanism in their territory is covered. While finding a specified percentage shareholding or ownership interest does not automatically result in finding the beneficial owner, it should be one evidential factor among others to be taken into account. Member States should be able, however, to decide that a lower percentage may be an indication of ownership or control.", "", "(13)", "", "Identification and verification of beneficial owners should, where relevant, extend to legal entities that own other legal entities, and obliged entities should look for the natural person(s) who ultimately exercises control through ownership or through other means of the legal entity that is the customer. Control through other means may, inter alia, include the criteria of control used for the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, such as through a shareholders' agreement, the exercise of dominant influence or the power to appoint senior management. There may be cases where no natural person is identifiable who ultimately owns or exerts control over a legal entity. In such exceptional cases, obliged entities, having exhausted all other means of identification, and provided there are no grounds for suspicion, may consider the senior managing official(s) to be the beneficial owner(s).", "", "(14)", "", "The need for accurate and up-to-date information on the beneficial owner is a key factor in tracing criminals who might otherwise hide their identity behind a corporate structure. Member States should therefore ensure that entities incorporated within their territory in accordance with national law obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on their beneficial ownership, in addition to basic information such as the company name and address and proof of incorporation and legal ownership. With a view to enhancing transparency in order to combat the misuse of legal entities, Member States should ensure that beneficial ownership information is stored in a central register located outside the company, in full compliance with Union law. Member States can, for that purpose, use a central database which collects beneficial ownership information, or the business register, or another central register. Member States may decide that obliged entities are responsible for filling in the register. Member States should make sure that in all cases that information is made available to competent authorities and FIUs and is provided to obliged entities when the latter take customer due diligence measures. Member States should also ensure that other persons who are able to demonstrate a legitimate interest with respect to money laundering, terrorist financing, and the associated predicate offences, such as corruption, tax crimes and fraud, are granted access to beneficial ownership information, in accordance with data protection rules. The persons who are able to demonstrate a legitimate interest should have access to information on the nature and extent of the beneficial interest held consisting of its approximate weight.", "", "(15)", "", "For that purpose, Member States should be able, under national law, to allow for access that is wider than the access provided for under this Directive.", "", "(16)", "", "Timely access to information on beneficial ownership should be ensured in ways which avoid any risk of tipping off the company concerned.", "", "(17)", "", "In order to ensure a level playing field among the different types of legal forms, trustees should also be required to obtain, hold and provide beneficial ownership information to obliged entities taking customer due diligence measures and to communicate that information to a central register or a central database and they should disclose their status to obliged entities. Legal entities such as foundations and legal arrangements similar to trusts should be subject to equivalent requirements.", "", "(18)", "", "This Directive should also apply to activities of obliged entities which are performed on the internet.", "", "(19)", "", "New technologies provide time-effective and cost-effective solutions to businesses and to customers and should therefore be taken into account when evaluating risk. The competent authorities and obliged entities should be proactive in combating new and innovative ways of money laundering.", "", "(20)", "", "The representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are encouraged to implement this Directive and to publish on its website AML/CFT policies, containing detailed procedures that would give effect to this Directive.", "", "(21)", "", "The use of gambling sector services to launder the proceeds of criminal activity is of concern. In order to mitigate the risks relating to gambling services, this Directive should provide for an obligation for providers of gambling services posing higher risks to apply customer due diligence measures for single transactions amounting to EUR 2 000 or more. Member States should ensure that obliged entities apply the same threshold to the collection of winnings, wagering a stake, including by the purchase and exchange of gambling chips, or both. Providers of gambling services with physical premises, such as casinos and gaming houses, should ensure that customer due diligence, if it is taken at the point of entry to the premises, can be linked to the transactions conducted by the customer on those premises. However, in proven low-risk circumstances, Member States should be allowed to exempt certain gambling services from some or all of the requirements laid down in this Directive. The use of an exemption by a Member State should be considered only in strictly limited and justified circumstances, and where the risks of money laundering or terrorist financing are low. Such exemptions should be subject to a specific risk assessment which also considers the degree of vulnerability of the applicable transactions. They should be notified to the Commission. In the risk assessment, Member States should indicate how they have taken into account any relevant findings in the reports issued by the Commission in the framework of the supranational risk assessment.", "", "(22)", "", "The risk of money laundering and terrorist financing is not the same in every case. Accordingly, a holistic, risk-based approach should be used. The risk-based approach is not an unduly permissive option for Member States and obliged entities. It involves the use of evidence-based decision-making in order to target the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing facing the Union and those operating within it more effectively.", "", "(23)", "", "Underpinning the risk-based approach is the need for Member States and the Union to identify, understand and mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing that they face. The importance of a supranational approach to risk identification has been recognised at international level, and the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) (EIOPA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), should be tasked with issuing an opinion, through their Joint Committee, on the risks affecting the Union financial sector.", "", "(24)", "", "The Commission is well placed to review specific cross-border threats that could affect the internal market and that cannot be identified and effectively combatted by individual Member States. It should therefore be entrusted with the responsibility for coordinating the assessment of risks relating to cross-border activities. Involvement of the relevant experts, such as the Expert Group on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and the representatives from the FIUs, as well as, where appropriate, from other Union-level bodies, is essential for the effectiveness of that process. National risk assessments and experience are also an important source of information for the process. Such assessment of the cross-border risks by the Commission should not involve the processing of personal data. In any event, data should be fully anonymised. National and Union data protection supervisory authorities should be involved only if the assessment of the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing has an impact on the privacy and data protection of individuals.", "", "(25)", "", "The results of risk assessments should, where appropriate, be made available to obliged entities in a timely manner to enable them to identify, understand, manage and mitigate their own risks.", "", "(26)", "", "In addition, to identify, understand, manage and mitigate risks at Union level to an even greater degree, Member States should make available the results of their risk assessments to each other, to the Commission and to EBA, EIOPA and ESMA (the ‘ESAs’).", "", "(27)", "", "When applying this Directive, it is appropriate to take account of the characteristics and needs of smaller obliged entities which fall under its scope, and to ensure treatment which is appropriate to their specific needs, and the nature of the business.", "", "(28)", "", "In order to protect the proper functioning of the Union financial system and of the internal market from money laundering and terrorist financing, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in order to identify third-country jurisdictions which have strategic deficiencies in their national AML/CFT regimes (‘high-risk third countries’). The changing nature of money laundering and terrorist financing threats, facilitated by a constant evolution of technology and of the means at the disposal of criminals, requires that quick and continuous adaptations of the legal framework as regards high-risk third countries be made in order to address efficiently existing risks and prevent new ones from arising. The Commission should take into account information from international organisations and standard setters in the field of AML/CFT, such as FATF public statements, mutual evaluation or detailed assessment reports or published follow-up reports, and adapt its assessments to the changes therein, where appropriate.", "", "(29)", "", "Member States should at least provide for enhanced customer due diligence measures to be applied by the obliged entities when dealing with natural persons or legal entities established in high-risk third countries identified by the Commission. Reliance on third parties established in such high-risk third countries should also be prohibited. Countries not included in the list should not be automatically considered to have effective AML/CFT systems and natural persons or legal entities established in such countries should be assessed on a risk-sensitive basis.", "", "(30)", "", "Risk itself is variable in nature, and the variables, on their own or in combination, may increase or decrease the potential risk posed, thus having an impact on the appropriate level of preventative measures, such as customer due diligence measures. Therefore, there are circumstances in which enhanced due diligence should be applied and others in which simplified due diligence may be appropriate.", "", "(31)", "", "It should be recognised that certain situations present a greater risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Although the identity and business profile of all customers should be established, there are cases in which particularly rigorous customer identification and verification procedures are required.", "", "(32)", "", "This is particularly true of relationships with individuals who hold or who have held important public functions, within the Union or internationally, and particularly individuals from countries where corruption is widespread. Such relationships may expose the financial sector in particular to significant reputational and legal risks. The international effort to combat corruption also justifies the need to pay particular attention to such persons and to apply appropriate enhanced customer due diligence measures with respect to persons who are or who have been entrusted with prominent public functions domestically or abroad and with respect to senior figures in international organisations.", "", "(33)", "", "The requirements relating to politically exposed persons are of a preventive and not criminal nature, and should not be interpreted as stigmatising politically exposed persons as being involved in criminal activity. Refusing a business relationship with a person simply on the basis of the determination that he or she is a politically exposed person is contrary to the letter and spirit of this Directive and of the revised FATF Recommendations.", "", "(34)", "", "Obtaining approval from senior management for establishing business relationships does not need to imply, in all cases, obtaining approval from the board of directors. It should be possible for such approval to be granted by someone with sufficient knowledge of the institution's money laundering and terrorist financing risk exposure and of sufficient seniority to take decisions affecting its risk exposure.", "", "(35)", "", "In order to avoid repeated customer identification procedures, leading to delays and inefficiency in business, it is appropriate, subject to suitable safeguards, to allow customers whose identification has been carried out elsewhere to be introduced to the obliged entities. Where an obliged entity relies on a third party, the ultimate responsibility for customer due diligence should remain with the obliged entity to which the customer is introduced.

In this respect, due regard should be given to the type of execution venue and the type of financial instrument concerned.", "", "(2)", "", "In order to fully assess the extent of the quality of execution of transactions that take place in the Union, it is appropriate that execution venues which may be selected by investment firms to execute client orders comply with requirements on data to be provided by execution venues in accordance with this Regulation. To this effect, these execution venues should include regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities, organised trading facilities, systematic internalisers, market makers and other liquidity providers.", "", "(3)", "", "Differences in the type of execution venue and financial instruments require that the content of reporting should vary depending on several factors. It is appropriate to differentiate the amount and nature of reported data according to trading systems, trading modes and trading platforms to provide a proper context for the quality of execution obtained.", "", "(4)", "", "To avoid inappropriate comparison between execution venues and ensure the relevance of collected data, execution venues should submit separate reports corresponding to segments that operate different order books or that are regulated differently or use different market segment identifiers.", "", "(5)", "", "To ensure an accurate picture of the quality of execution that effectively occurred, trading venues should not publish among executed orders those traded over the counter and reported onto the trading venue.", "", "(6)", "", "When market makers and other liquidity providers are reporting as execution venues for financial instruments which are not subject to the trading obligation, they should only publish information on the orders executed or the price quoted for their clients when the orders are either quoted or executed over the counter, or executed pursuant to Articles 4 and 9 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, excluding orders which are held in an order management facility of a trading venue pending disclosure.", "", "(7)", "", "It is appropriate to consider that other liquidity providers should include firms that hold themselves out as being willing to deal on own account, and which provide liquidity as part of their normal business activity, whether or not they have formal agreements in place or commit to providing liquidity on a continuous basis.", "", "(8)", "", "In order to have complete transparency on the quality of execution for transactions in relation to price, it is appropriate that the information provided in relation to price should exclude all commissions or accrued interest, where relevant.", "", "(9)", "", "In determining appropriate information for assessing price quality, both daily average levels and point-in-time information should be required. This will provide participants with an appropriate context and a more complete picture when analysing the quality of execution obtained. In order to allow for price comparisons between financial instruments it is also necessary to specify the currency code of any reported transaction.", "", "(10)", "", "To ensure regulatory consistency, it is not appropriate to require trading venues to provide details of transactions that remain, at the time of publication, subject to a deferral of publication in compliance with requirements on post trade transparency. It is appropriate that systematic internalisers, market makers and other liquidity providers be exempt from publishing point-in-time transaction data for any transactions above standard market size or above size specific to the financial instrument in order to avoid those venues becoming subject to undue risk of disclosing commercially sensitive information that might hinder their ability to hedge exposures and provide liquidity. For shares, exchange-traded funds and certificates deemed to be illiquid under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the standard market size threshold to be used is the minimum available standard market size for that type of financial instrument. To avoid uncertainty, it is appropriate to clarify that reference to large in scale and size specific to the financial instrument have the same meaning as set out in the post trade transparency requirements.", "", "(11)", "", "It is essential to have full transparency on all costs charged when executing an order through a given venue. It is necessary to specify all costs in the execution of a client order relevant to the use of a specific venue and for which the client pays directly or indirectly. Those costs should include execution fees, including fees for the submission, modification or cancellation of orders or quotes withdrawals, as well as any fees related to market data access or use of terminals. The relevant costs may also include clearing or settlement fees or any other fees paid to third parties involved in the execution of the order when they are part of the services provided by the execution venue. Information on costs should also include taxes or levies directly invoiced to or incurred by the venue on behalf of the members or users of the execution venue or the client to whom the order refers.", "", "(12)", "", "Likelihood of execution indicates the probability of execution of a particular type of order and is supported by details on trading volumes in a particular instrument or other characteristics of orders and transactions. Information on likelihood of execution should allow for the calculation of metrics such as the relative market size of a venue in a particular financial instrument or a class of financial instruments. Likelihood of execution should also be assessed with data on failed transactions or cancelled or modified orders.", "", "(13)", "", "Speed of execution may have different meanings for the different types of execution venues as the measurement of speed varies by both trading systems and trading platform. For continuous auction order books, speed of execution should be expressed in milliseconds while for other trading systems it is appropriate to use larger units of time. It is also appropriate to exclude the latency of a particular participant's connection to the execution venue, as this is outside of the control of the execution venue itself.", "", "(14)", "", "In order to compare the quality of execution for orders of different size, execution venues should be required to report on transactions within several size ranges. The thresholds for these ranges should be dependent on the type of financial instrument and its liquidity to ensure that they provide an adequate sample of executions in a size that is typical in that instrument.", "", "(15)", "", "It is important that execution venues collect data throughout the normal hours of their operation. Reporting should therefore be made without charge in a machine readable electronic format via an internet website to enable the public to download, search, sort and analyse all the provided data.", "", "(16)", "", "The reports by execution venues should be complemented by the output of a consolidated tape provider established by Directive 2014/65/EU thus allowing for the development of enhanced measures of execution quality.", "", "(17)", "", "For reasons of consistency and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, it is necessary that the provisions laid down in this Regulation and the provisions laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 apply from the same date.", "", "(18)", "", "This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.", "", "(19)", "", "ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3),", "", "HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:"], "pad": 0, "friendly_name": "", "level": 0, "document_level": 2, "title": ["COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2017/575", "of 8 June 2016", "supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to regulatory technical standards concerning the data to be published by execution venues on the quality of execution of transactions"], "title-offset": 3, "has_text": 0}, "key": "DOC [0]"}, {"predecessors": ["DOC [0]"], "successors": ["TITLE 0[2]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 1, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "PART 0", "title": ["Padding PART"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-575/part-0"}, "key": "PART 0[1]"}, {"predecessors": ["PART 0[1]"], "successors": ["CHAPTER 0[3]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 2, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "TITLE 0", "title": ["Padding TITLE"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-575/part-0/title-0"}, "key": "TITLE 0[2]"}, {"predecessors": ["TITLE 0[2]"], "successors": ["SECTION 0[4]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 3, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "CHAPTER 0", "title": ["Padding CHAPTER"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-575/part-0/title-0/chapter-0"}, "key": "CHAPTER 0[3]"}, {"predecessors": ["CHAPTER 0[3]"], "successors": ["ARTICLE 1[5]", "ARTICLE 3[7]", "ARTICLE 9[13]", "ARTICLE 11[15]", "ARTICLE 6[10]", "ARTICLE 8[12]", "ARTICLE 5[9]", "ARTICLE 12[16]", "ARTICLE 10[14]", "ARTICLE 2[6]", "ARTICLE 4[8]", "ARTICLE 7[11]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 4, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "SECTION 0", "title": ["Padding SECTION"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-575/part-0/title-0/chapter-0/section-0"}, "key": "SECTION 0[4]"}, {"predecessors": ["SECTION 0[4]"], "successors": ["PARAGRAPH 1[5_1]"], "content": {"pad": 0, "text": [], "level": 5, "title-offset": 1, "meta": "ARTICLE 1", "title": ["Subject matter"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-575/part-0/title-0/chapter-0/section-0/article-1"}, "key": "ARTICLE 1[5]"}, {"predecessors": ["ARTICLE 1[5]"], "successors": [], "content": {"text_tagged": " This Regulation lays down the specific content, the format and the periodicity of the data to be published by <financial-object>execution venues</financial-object> relating to the quality of execution of <financial-object>transactions</financial-object>.

In order to make meaningful comparisons and analyse the choice of top five execution venues it is necessary that information is published by investment firms specifically in respect of each class of financial instruments. In order to be able to fully evaluate the order flow of client orders to execution venues, investors and the public should be able to clearly identify if the investment firm itself was one of the top five execution venues for each class of financial instrument.", "", "(2)", "", "In order to fully assess the extent of the quality of execution being obtained on execution venues used by investment firms to execute client orders, including execution venues in third countries, it is appropriate that investment firms publish information required under this Regulation in relation to trading venues, market makers or other liquidity providers or any entity that performs a similar function in a third country to the functions performed by any of the foregoing.", "", "(3)", "", "In order to provide precise and comparable information, it is necessary to set out classes of financial instruments based on their characteristics relevant for publication purposes. A class of financial instruments should be narrow enough to reveal differences in order execution behaviour between classes but at the same time broad enough to ensure that the reporting obligation on investment firms is proportionate. Given the breadth of the equity class of financial instruments, it is appropriate to divide this class into subclasses based on liquidity. As liquidity is an essential factor governing execution behaviours and as execution venues are often competing to attract flows of the most frequently traded stocks, it is appropriate that equity instruments are classified according to their liquidity as determined under the tick size regime as set out in Directive 2014/65/EU.", "", "(4)", "", "When publishing the identity of the top five execution venues on which they execute client orders it is appropriate for investment firms to publish information on the volume and number of orders executed on each execution venue, so that investors may be able to form an opinion as to the flow of client orders from the firm to execution venue. Where, for one or several classes of financial instruments, an investment firm only executes a very small number of orders, information on the top five execution venues would not be very meaningful nor representative of order execution arrangements. It is therefore appropriate to require investment firms to clearly indicate the classes of financial instruments for which they execute a very small number of orders.", "", "(5)", "", "To prevent potentially market sensitive disclosures on the volume of business being conducted by the investment firm, the volume of execution and the number of executed orders should be expressed as a percentage of the investment firm's total execution volumes and total number of executed orders in that class of financial instrument, respectively, rather than as absolute values.", "", "(6)", "", "It is appropriate to require investment firms to publish information which is relevant to their order execution behaviour. To ensure that investment firms are not held accountable for order execution decisions for which they are not responsible, it is appropriate for investment firms to disclose the percentage of orders executed on each of the top five execution venues where the choice of execution venue has been specified by clients.", "", "(7)", "", "There are several factors which may potentially influence the order execution behaviour of investment firms such as close links between investment firms and execution venues. Given the potential materiality of these factors it is appropriate to require analysis of such factors in assessing the quality of execution obtained on all execution venues.", "", "(8)", "", "The different order types can be an important factor in explaining how and why investment firms execute orders on a given execution venue. It may also impact the way an investment firm will set its execution strategies, including programming of smart order routers to meet the specific objectives of those orders. It is therefore appropriate that a distinction between the different categories of order types be clearly marked in the report.", "", "(9)", "", "In order to properly analyse information it is important that users are in a position to differentiate between execution venues used for professional client orders and execution venues used for retail client orders, given the notable differences in how investment firms obtain the best possible result for retail clients as compared to professional clients, namely that investment firms must predominantly assess the factors of price and cost when executing orders from retail clients. Therefore it is appropriate that information on the top five execution venues be provided separately for retail clients and for professional clients respectively, permitting a qualitative assessment to be made of the order flow to such venues.", "", "(10)", "", "In order to comply with the legal obligation of best execution, investment firms, when applying the criteria for best execution for professional clients, will typically not use the same execution venues for securities financing transactions (SFTs) and other transactions. This is because the SFTs are used as a source of funding subject to a commitment that the borrower will return equivalent securities on a future date and the terms of SFTs are typically defined bilaterally between the counterparties ahead of the execution. Therefore, the choice of execution venues for SFTs is more limited than in the case of other transactions, given that it depends on the particular terms defined in advance between the counterparties and on whether there is a specific demand on those execution venues for the financial instruments involved. It is therefore appropriate that investment firms summarise and make public the top five execution venues in terms of trading volumes where they executed SFTs in a separate report so that that a qualitative assessment can be made of the order flow to such venues. Due to the specific nature of SFTs, and given that their large size would likely distort the more representative set of client transactions (namely, those not involving SFTs), it is also necessary to exclude them from the tables concerning the top five execution venues on which investment firms execute other client orders", "", "(11)", "", "It is appropriate that investment firms should publish an assessment of quality of execution obtained on all venues used by the firm. This information will provide a clear picture of the execution strategies and tools used to assess the quality of execution obtained on those venues. This information will also allow investors to assess the effectiveness of the monitoring carried out by investment firms in relation to those execution venues.", "", "(12)", "", "In specifically assessing the quality of execution obtained on all execution venues in relation to cost, it is appropriate that an investment firm also performs an analysis of the arrangements it has with these venues in relation to payments made or received and to discounts, rebates or non-monetary benefits received. Such an assessment should also allow the public to consider how such arrangements impact the costs faced by the investor and how they comply with Article 27(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU.", "", "(13)",

execution venues under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/575 (2).", "", "(14)", "", "Information on identity of execution venues and on the quality of execution should be published annually and should refer to order execution behaviour for each class of financial instruments in order to capture relevant changes within the preceding calendar year.", "", "(15)", "", "Investment firms should not be prevented from adopting an additional level of reporting which is more granular, provided that in such case the additional report complements and does not replace what is required under this Regulation.", "", "(16)", "", "For reasons of consistency and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, it is necessary that the provisions laid down in this Regulation

It is therefore necessary to improve both the accessibility and the quality of data available to competent authorities and ESMA in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 so that the classification of financial instruments, including the thresholds for the purposes of pre-trade and post-trade transparency, and, where necessary, re-calibrations of these thresholds, can be calculated on a more informed basis after the regime has been applied for a certain period of time.", "", "(3)", "", "Provisions should be laid down specifying, in general terms, the common elements with regard to the content and format of data to be submitted by trading venues, approved publication arrangements (APAs) and consolidated tape providers (CTPs) for the purposes of transparency and other calculations. Those provisions should be read in conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/587 (3), (EU) 2017/583 (4), (EU) 2017/567 (5), (EU) 2017/565 (6) and (EU) 2016/2020 (7) which describe the methodology and data necessary to perform the relevant calculations and specify the content and scope of the data necessary to perform the transparency calculations. Therefore, the content, format and quality of the data submitted with regard to trading venues, APAs and CTPs should be consistent with the applicable methodology prescribed in the relevant implementing acts of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 when performing such calculations.", "", "(4)", "", "With the exception of potential ad-hoc data requests and calculations to be performed for the purposes of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should submit reports on a daily basis. Considering the broad scope of financial instruments covered and the large amount of data to be processed, this daily submission enables competent authorities to more accurately process files of manageable sizes and ensures an efficient and timely management of the data submission, data quality check and data processing. Collecting data on a daily basis also simplifies the data provision obligation on trading venues, APAs and CTPs by alleviating them from the burden of calculating the number of trading days in the cases where that quantitative liquidity criterion is applicable, and of aggregating data for the same financial instrument across different time maturity buckets in the cases where the time to maturity has to be considered. Centralising that calculation also ensures a consistent use of the criteria across financial instruments and trading venues.", "", "(5)", "", "Trading venues should store data that is comprehensive and allows competent authorities and ESMA to perform accurate calculations. While the required information is usually provided in the post-trade reports, in some cases, the information necessary for the calculations goes beyond the information available in those reports. This includes, for example, information on transactions executed on the basis of orders that benefitted from the large in scale waiver. This information should not be included in trade reports since it could expose such transactions to adverse market impact. However, since that information might be necessary for competent authorities to perform accurate calculations, it should be stored appropriately by trading venues, APAs and CTPs and communicated to competent authorities and ESMA where necessary. Trading venues should ensure that they adequately disseminate the information to be provided to competent authorities and ESMA. Transactions executed on the basis of large in scale orders should be appropriately identified in their report to CTPs.", "", "(6)", "", "Data should be collected from a variety of sources since a single source may not always hold a complete data set for an asset class or even a particular instrument. Therefore, to allow competent authorities and ESMA to obtain and consolidate high quality data from various sources, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should use, where available, pre-set specifications in terms of content and format in order to make the data collection easier and more cost efficient.", "", "(7)", "", "Considering the sensitivity of the necessary calculations and the potential commercial consequences for trading venues, issuers and other market participants of publishing incorrect information which could lead, in the case of the volume cap mechanism, to the suspension of the use of the waivers for one particular venue or across the Union for one particular financial instrument, it is crucial to clarify the format of the data to be submitted to competent authorities and ESMA in order to set up efficient communication channels with trading venues and CTPs and ensure timely and correct publication of the required data.", "", "(8)", "", "Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires ESMA to publish, for financial instruments to which the volume cap mechanism applies, measurements of the total volume of trading in the previous 12 months and of the percentages of trading under both the negotiated trade and reference price waivers across the Union and on each trading venue in the previous 12 months. In case of financial instruments traded in more than one currency, it is necessary to convert the volumes executed in different currencies into one common currency so as to enable the computation of those volumes and make the required calculations. Therefore, the methodology and exchange rates to be used to convert, where necessary, trading volumes should be provided for.", "", "(9)", "", "For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues should be required to report the volumes of trading executed under the reference price waiver and, for liquid instruments, the negotiated trade waiver. Given that the waivers apply to orders and not to transactions, it is important to clarify that the volumes to be reported should include all transactions flagged with ‘RFPT’ or ‘NLIQ’ for the purpose of the post-trade publication of transactions and as specified in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/587. Where a transaction was executed on the basis of two orders benefitting from the large in scale waiver, this transaction should not count towards the volumes calculated under the reference price waiver and the negotiated trade waiver.", "", "(10)", "", "For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues and CTPs should ensure that the trading venue on which the transaction was executed is identified with sufficient granularity to allow ESMA to perform all calculations referred to in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. In particular, the trading venue identifier used should be unique for that trading venue and not shared with any other trading venue operated by the same market operator. Trading venue identifiers should allow ESMA to distinguish in an unequivocal manner all trading venues for which the market operator has received a specific authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU.", "", "(11)", "", "For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, it is necessary to require trading venues to submit a first report on the day of entry into application of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 with trading volumes under the reference price waiver and, for liquid financial instruments, negotiated transaction waiver for the preceding calendar year. To ensure a proportionate application of this requirement, trading venues should, for that purpose, base their report on the adjusted volumes of trading executed under equivalent waivers existing under Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 (9).", "", "(12)", "", "In order to provide competent authorities and ESMA with accurate data, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should ensure that their reports include single-counted transactions only.", "", "(13)", "", "The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with specifying the content, frequency, format of data requests, the method to be used to process this data and other specifications relating to the publication of information for the purposes of transparency as defined under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which will enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders, and in particular those subject to the obligations, it is desirable to include them in a single Regulation.", "", "(14)", "", "For reasons of consistency and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, it is necessary that the

To this end, it is appropriate to identify financial instruments and trading systems that increase the risk of high volatility and for which it is crucial that the provision of liquidity is incentivised, in order to ensure orderly and efficient functioning of markets.

Therefore, there should be a scheme of incentives to limit a sudden and large-scale withdrawal of liquidity under stressed market conditions. In order to avoid divergent application of this obligation, it is important that trading venues communicate the existence of stressed market conditions to all parties to the market making scheme. Exceptional circumstances should be determined exhaustively and therefore do not include any regular or pre-planned information events that may affect the fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in the perception of market risk, whether occurring during or outside trading hours.", "", "(9)", "", "Members, participants or clients having signed a market making agreement have to meet a minimum set of requirements in terms of presence, size and spread in all cases. However, the members, participants or clients meeting those minimum requirements only under normal trading conditions may not necessarily access any type of incentive. Trading venues may establish market making schemes which only reward members, participants or clients meeting more stringent parameters in terms of presence, size and spread. The market making schemes put in place by trading venues should therefore clearly indicate the conditions for accessing incentives and should take into account the effective contribution to the liquidity in the trading venue measured in terms of presence, size and spread by the participants in the schemes.", "", "(10)", "", "In order to prevent divergent application of this Regulation and to ensure fair and non-discriminatory implementation of market making schemes, it is crucial that all members of, participants in and clients of a trading venue are informed in a coordinated manner of the occurrence of exceptional circumstances.

However, in order to enable effective and efficient collation, comparison and analysis of the relevant order data for market monitoring purposes, such information should be made available to the competent authorities using uniform standards and formats where a competent authority requests such information pursuant to Article 25(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.", "", "(2)", "", "In order to ensure clarity, legal certainty and avoid double storage of the same information this Regulation should cover all data elements relating to orders, including details that are to be reported in accordance with Article 26(1) and (3).", "", "(3)", "", "In order to detect and investigate potential or attempted market abuse effectively, competent authorities need to promptly identify persons and entities who may be significantly involved in the order process, including members or participants of trading venues, entities responsible for investment and execution decisions, non-executing brokers and clients on whose behalf orders are initiated. Accordingly operators of trading venues should maintain designations for such parties.", "", "(4)", "", "In order to allow competent authorities to more efficiently identify suspicious patterns of potentially abusive behaviour originating from one client, including where the client is operating through a number of investment firms, the operators of trading venues should record the identity of clients on whose behalf their members or participants submitted the order. Operators should identify those clients by unique identifiers in order to facilitate certain and efficient identification of such persons and thereby facilitate more effective analysis of potential market abuse in which clients may be involved.", "", "(5)", "", "Operators of trading venues should not be required to record client identifiers for all clients in the trading chain but only for the client on whose behalf the member or participant submitted the order.", "", "(6)", "", "The identification of market-making strategies or similar activities is important in order to enable efficient detection of market manipulation. This allows the competent authorities to distinguish the order flow coming from an investment firm acting on the basis of terms pre-determined by the issuer of the instrument which is the subject of the order or by the trading venue to which the order is submitted from the order flow coming from an investment firm acting at its own or at its client's discretion.", "", "(7)", "", "The record of the precise date and time and of the details of any order placement, modification, cancellation, rejection and execution should be maintained. This allows monitoring the changes to the order throughout its lifetime, which can be significant in detecting and assessing potential market manipulation and front running behaviours.", "", "(8)", "", "To ensure an accurate and complete picture of the order book of a trading venue, competent authorities require information on trading sessions in which financial instruments are traded. This information can notably be used to determine when auction periods or continuous trading start and finish and whether orders cause unscheduled circuit breakers. This information is also required to identify how orders will interact, particularly when sessions end at random periods such as auctions. Information on indicative uncrossing prices and volumes would also assist in analysing possible auction manipulation. Given that a single order can impact either the auction uncrossing price, auction uncrossing volume or both, competent authorities need to see the impact of each order on these values. Without this information it would be difficult to identify which order has had the impact on those values. Additionally, a sequence number should be assigned to each relevant event in order to determine the sequence of events when two or more events take place at the same time.", "", "(9)", "", "Specification of the position of the orders in an order book allows for the reconstruction of the order book and for analysis of the sequence of execution of orders which is an important element of market abuse surveillance. The position assigned to an order depends on how priority is determined by the trading system. Therefore, operators of trading venues should assign and maintain details of the priority of orders according to the price visibility-time priority or the size-time priority method.", "", "(10)", "", "In order to enable effective market monitoring it is necessary to be able to link orders with their corresponding transactions.

This detailed information is essential for competent authorities to be able to monitor, as part of its market abuse surveillance, trading activity in a given trading venue order book and in particular to replicate how each order behaves within the order book. However, given the broad range of existing and potential new order types designed by operators of trading venues and the specific technicalities attached to the latter, the maintenance of this detailed information according to the operators' internal classification system may not currently allow competent authorities to replicate the order book activity of all trading venues in a consistent manner. Therefore, for competent authorities to be in a position to exactly locate each order within the order book, operators of trading venues should also classify each order received either as a limit order where the order is tradable or as a stop order where the order becomes tradable only upon the realisation of a pre-determined price event.", "", "(12)", "", "For reasons of consistency and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, it is necessary that the provisions laid down in this Regulation and the provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 apply from the same date.", "", "(13)", "", "This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.", "", "(14)", "", "ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2),", "", "HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:"], "pad": 0, "friendly_name": "", "level": 0, "document_level": 2, "title": ["COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2017/580", "of 24 June 2016", "supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the maintenance of relevant data relating to orders in financial instruments"], "title-offset": 3, "has_text": 0}, "key": "DOC [0]"}, {"predecessors": ["DOC [0]"], "successors": ["TITLE 0[2]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 1, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "PART 0", "title": ["Padding PART"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0"}, "key": "PART 0[1]"}, {"predecessors": ["PART 0[1]"], "successors": ["CHAPTER 0[3]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 2, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "TITLE 0", "title": ["Padding TITLE"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0/title-0"}, "key": "TITLE 0[2]"}, {"predecessors": ["TITLE 0[2]"], "successors": ["SECTION 0[4]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 3, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "CHAPTER 0", "title": ["Padding CHAPTER"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0/title-0/chapter-0"}, "key": "CHAPTER 0[3]"}, {"predecessors": ["CHAPTER 0[3]"], "successors": ["ARTICLE 14[18]", "ARTICLE 1[5]", "ARTICLE 13[17]", "ARTICLE 3[7]", "ARTICLE 9[13]", "ARTICLE 11[15]", "ARTICLE 6[10]", "ARTICLE 8[12]", "ARTICLE 5[9]", "ARTICLE 12[16]", "ARTICLE 10[14]", "ARTICLE 2[6]", "ARTICLE 4[8]", "ARTICLE 7[11]"], "content": {"pad": 1, "text": [], "level": 4, "title-offset": 0, "meta": "SECTION 0", "title": ["Padding SECTION"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0/title-0/chapter-0/section-0"}, "key": "SECTION 0[4]"}, {"predecessors": ["SECTION 0[4]"], "successors": ["PARAGRAPH 2[5_2]", "PARAGRAPH 1[5_1]"], "content": {"pad": 0, "text": [], "level": 5, "title-offset": 1, "meta": "ARTICLE 1", "title": ["Scope, standards and format of relevant order data"], "has_title": 1, "has_text": 0, "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0/title-0/chapter-0/section-0/article-1"}, "key": "ARTICLE 1[5]"}, {"predecessors": ["ARTICLE 1[5]"], "successors": [], "content": {"text_tagged": " Operators of <financial-object>trading venues</financial-object> <deontic-obligation>shall</deontic-obligation> keep at the disposal of <authorities><authorities>their competent authority</authorities></authorities> the details of each <financial-object>order</financial-object> advertised through their systems set out in Articles 2 to 13 as specified in the second and third columns of Table 2 of the Annex insofar as they pertain to the <financial-object>order</financial-object> concerned.", "industry": "finance", "id": "commission-delegated-regulation-eu-2017-580/part-0/title-0/chapter-0/section-0/article-1/paragraph-1", "seq_number": 1, "label": "not_evaluated", "meta": "PARAGRAPH 1", "text_tagged_high_level": " Operators of trading venues <goal(deontic-obligation)>shall keep at the disposal of their competent authority the details of each order advertised through their systems set out in Articles 2 to 13 as specified in the second and third columns of Table 2 of the Annex insofar as they pertain to the order concerned.</goal(deontic-obligation)>", "text": ["1.

An appropriate way of doing this is for the party denying access to clearly outline the changes in risk management that would arise from granting access, how it would have to manage the risk associated with changes in consequence of granting access, and to explain the impact on its activities.", "", "(3)", "", "Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 does not distinguish between risks incurred by CCPs and trading venues when granting access and includes the same general categories of conditions to be considered by trading venues and CCPs when assessing access requests. However, due to the different nature of the activities of CCPs as compared to trading venues, risks stemming from granting access may in practice impact CCPs and trading venues differently, thus demanding an approach differentiating between CCPs and trading venues.", "", "(4)", "", "When a competent authority assesses whether access would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets or adversely affect systemic risk, it should consider whether the CCP or trading venue in question has adequate risk management procedures, including with respect to operational and legal risks, to avoid the access agreement creating significant undue risks to third parties that cannot be mitigated.", "", "(5)", "", "The terms under which access must be permitted should be reasonable and non-discriminatory so as not to undermine the purpose of non-discriminatory access. Charging fees in a discriminatory way so as to deter access should not be permitted. However, fees could differ for objectively justified reasons, such as where the costs to implement the access arrangements are higher. When granting access CCPs and trading venues incur both one-off costs, such as assessing legal requirements, and ongoing costs. Since the scope of the access request and the associated costs for implementing the access agreement are likely to differ on a case-by-case basis, it is not appropriate to cover the specific allocation of costs between the CCP and the trading venue in this Regulation. However, the allocation of costs is an important element of an access agreement, therefore both parties should specify the coverage of costs in that agreement.", "", "(6)", "", "Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), a CCP wishing to extend its business to additional services or activities not covered by the initial authorisation should submit a request for an extension of authorisation. An extension of authorisation is needed where a CCP intends to offer clearing services on financial instruments with a different risk profile or that have material differences from the CCP's existing product set. When a contract traded on a trading venue to which a CCP has granted access is in a class of financial instruments covered by the CCP's existing authorisation and has therefore similar risk characteristics to the contracts already cleared by the CCP, such a contract should be considered as economically equivalent.", "", "(7)", "", "In order to ensure that a CCP does not apply discriminatory collateral and margining requirements to economically equivalent contracts traded on a trading venue that has been granted access to the CCP, any change to the margining methodology and operational requirements regarding margining and netting applied to economically equivalent contracts already cleared by the CCP should be subject to a review by the risk committee of the CCP and be considered as a significant change to the models and parameters for the purpose of the review procedure provided in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.

The methods used for calculating notional amount for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should enable genuinely smaller trading venues that have not yet acquired the technological capability to engage on an equal footing with the majority of the post-trade infrastructure market to make use of the opt-out mechanism.
